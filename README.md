**Executive Project Summary**

The purpose of this project is to develop an application that will serve as a Key Finder. This application will reduce the time people consumed finding their keys when are missing, by displaying the location of the keys on their Android phone or tablet screen in real time. The benefit of this application over other Key Finder technologies such as RFID, is that it uses Bluetooth Low energy device to function as signal transmitter which is powered by battery and configurable on Android mobile device. Other technologies such as RFID uses much more complicated expensive systems with different components, such as tags, readers, reader control and an application software. This application will be consisting of MetaWear Bluetooth low energy device that will be attached to the key chain plus Key Finder app for Android phone or tablets.This application will be highly accessible to users because Android smart phone or tablet will be use as primary receiver. 

**Project Goal and objectives**

• Develop an application to serve as a key finder

• MetaWear device to be attached to key chain

• Android tablet or phone to be used for application

• Downloaded android studio for app development

• This application will be simple and display information on Android device's screen

• MetaWear device and application will communicate using Bluetooth

• The device will possibly ring, beeps, or flush 

• Application will contain lookup button to locate MetaWear device

• App will also have connect button to connect to MetaWear device

• App design (Display, Layout, and function)

• App testing

If the goals and objectives above are met for Key Finder application, 
the application will help masses communities and industries locating their missing keys quickly and efficiently.

**User stories**

As a **Lookup app user**, I want to **click lookup app** to **find my keys quickly and efficiently**.

As a **Connect app user**, I want to **press connect app** to ** connect to the device via Bluetooth**.

As a **Disconnect app user**, I want to **push disconnect app**to **terminate connection to the device to maintain its power to avoid frequently charging**.


**Misuser Stories**

As a **app hacker** hacker want to **eavesdrop or disrupt the connection between the app and device**, **this affect app user locating keys**.

As for a **Physical damage** the **device will not function**, **this decrease the probability of finding or locating keys**.
