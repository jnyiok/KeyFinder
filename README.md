**Executive Project Summary**
The purpose of this project is to develop an application that will serve as a key finder. 
This application will locate key location and give the feedback in real time. 
This application will be consisted of MetaWear device to be attached to the key chain and an application that displays information Android device's screen.

**Project Goal and objectives**
• Develop an application to serve as a key finder
• MetaWear device to be attached to key chain
• Android tablet or phone to be used for application
• Downloaded android studio for app development
• This application will be simple and display information on Android device's screen
• MetaWear device and application will communicate using Bluetooth
• The device will possibly ring, beeps, or flush 
• Application will contain lookup button to locate MetaWear device
• App will also have connect button to connect to MetaWear device
• App design (Display, Layout, and function)
• App testing
If the goals and objectives above are met for this project, 
the application will enhance locating missing keys quickly and efficiently.

**User stories** 
As a **Lookup app user**, I want to **click lookup app** to **find my keys quickly and efficiently**.
As a **Connect app user**, I want to **press connect app** to ** connect to the device via Bluetooth**.
As a **Disconnect app user**, I want to **push disconnect app**to **terminate connection to the device to maintain its power to avoid frequently charging**.

**Misuser Stories**
As a **app hacker** hacker want to **eavesdrop or disrupt the connection between the app and device**, **this affect app user locating keys**.
As for a **Physical damage** the **device will not function**, **this decrease the probability of finding or locating keys**.
